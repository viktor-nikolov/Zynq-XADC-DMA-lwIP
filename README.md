### Acquisition Time

See Zynq 7000 XADC User Guide [UG480](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug480_7Series_XADC), chapter "Analog Input Description" (page 22 of the PDF version of UG480)

This is copy of [Figure 2-5](https://docs.amd.com/r/qOeib0vlzXa1isUAfuFzOQ/Jknshmzrw3DvMZgWJO73KQ?section=XREF_26771_X_Ref_Target) from UG480:

Equation 2-2 for acquisition time in unipolar mode:
$$t_{ACQ} = 9 \times ( R_{MUX} + R_{MUX} ) \times C_{SAMPLE}$$

In the case of Cora Z7, we need to take into account the unipolar input circuitry on the board as depicted in Figure 13.2.1 from the Cora Z7 [Reference Manual](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cora-z7/reference-manual#shield_analog_io):

In our case, $R_{MUX}$ is equal to 10 kΩ because we are using the auxiliary input VAUX1 (which is connected to pin A0 on the Cora Z7 board).  
In addition to $R_{MUX}$ we must include resistors in the signal path on the Cora Z7 board: 2.32 kΩ, 140 Ω and 845 Ω.  
$C_{SAMPLE}$ is specified by Xilinx as 3 pF.

We now calculate the needed acquisition time as fol1lows
$t_{ACQ} = 9 \times ( 10000 + 10000 + 2320 + 140 + 845 ) \times 3 \times 10^{-12} = 629\mskip3muns$
